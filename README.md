# barcode-generator
Proof of concept barcode sequence generator

Takes a range of badge numbers from a .yaml file and generates a CSV of
barcode-friendly ready IDs which are encrypted+encoded versions of the badge#'s

Generates results like this:

```
2000,x7nTwA
2001,wujv0A
2002,9RPlKw
2003,wtmw+w
2004,o3FLhg
2005,jZCi1Q
2006,v922ag
2007,06G2uA
2008,XRd8xQ
2009,io7SyQ
2010,5jio8w
2011,RqjgOQ
2012,KFrEEw
2013,c/gq2Q
2014,431pYg
2015,OyceoQ
2016,FGW79A
2017,lnv21g
2018,HdnBjw
2019,o3nx3A
... etc ....
```

This whole thing might want to be more carefully thought out inside ubersystem, but for now here's some proof of concept code.
